An interactive stimulative experience for the consciousness
to run through. multiple simulations can exist at the same
time.

all interactions involving additions at the end of the consciousness
are called feature branches. there will be inherent instability
in the environment here.

All users are granted two levels, approval for finishing acts
and then unlimited scripted play.

the first will be a world records competition. Outperforming the
system in any way will unlock features for the being to Choose
the next experiences.

the second will be an environment request form. Suggested to
gameplay of their local zones, players must recreate their
experience with different variables in play.

This is where halfies is.
time is regressing, and it's 1992
Ubik prevents half lifers from vanishing. in the economic sense
of a consumer needing to produce that will create data for their
further intelligent existence

Be in search of Ubik.
It's a commodity
There's an urge to update and identify yourself.
The mentality is to run the testees through problem-
solving capabilities to complete mastery of their
scanned replicas that will be the basis of their artificial
intelligence.
